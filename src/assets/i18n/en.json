For this, I asked him to regroup his questions and remarks to the maximum so that we made a daily update on his difficulties, except in case of complete blocking where he could come to see me. Finally, after nearly a month, he became completely autonomous on simple tasks and was able to perform more complex ones by asking for help if needed to the other members of the team."
